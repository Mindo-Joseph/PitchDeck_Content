# AI-driven Wildlife Conservation System

---
## Abstract

This project will develop an AI-driven system to monitor endangered species and protect them from poachers. The system will use AI to track the migration patterns of endangered species and use that information to deter poachers.

---
## Problem

Endangered species are at risk due to human activities such as poaching, habitat destruction, and climate change. Without proper conservation efforts, many species will become extinct.

---
## Solution

We propose an AI-driven system to monitor endangered species and protect them from poachers. The system will use AI to track the migration patterns of endangered species and use that information to deter poachers.

---
## Benefits

The system will provide a powerful tool to aid in conservation efforts by monitoring and protecting endangered species. It will also provide a way to track and analyze migration patterns, which can be used to inform conservation efforts.

---
## Technical Details

The system will use a combination of AI and IoT sensors to track the migration patterns of endangered species and detect poachers. The data will be analyzed by the AI to identify suspicious behavior and alert authorities if necessary.

---
## Implementation Plan

The system will be developed in three phases:

1. Design and implementation of the AI and IoT sensors.
2. Data collection and analysis.
3. Deployment of the system and monitoring of endangered species.

---
## Timeline

The project will take 12 months to complete.

---
## Conclusion

This AI-driven system will provide a powerful tool to aid in conservation efforts by monitoring and protecting endangered species. It will also provide a way to track and analyze migration patterns, which can be used to inform conservation efforts.

# Build a simple calculator using the Tkinter GUI toolkit

## Introduction

We plan to create a basic calculator application using the Tkinter GUI toolkit. Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python, and has a wide range of widgets, making it suitable for this project. We have chosen this toolkit due to its ease of use and wide range of features.

## Business Goals

Our goal is to create a simple, intuitive calculator application that is easy to use for novice users. We also aim to ensure that the application is extensible, so that it can be used for more complex calculations in the future.

## Design

The application will be designed in a simple, user-friendly manner. We plan to use Tkinter's widgets to create the main window, buttons, and the calculator display. The application will also support basic calculations and functions, such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication.

## Development

We plan to use Python and Tkinter to develop the application. We will use object-oriented programming to create the main window, buttons, and the calculator display. We will also use event-driven programming to handle user interactions.

## Benefits

The application will be easy to use, with a straightforward user interface. It will also be extensible, so that it can be used for more complex calculations in the future. Finally, the application will be open source, so that it can be used and modified by anyone.

## Conclusion

We plan to create a simple calculator application using the Tkinter GUI toolkit. The application will be easy to use and extensible, making it suitable for both novice and experienced users. We believe that this project will be a great success, and look forward to creating it.

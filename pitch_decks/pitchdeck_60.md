## What is it?

We are creating an app that curates and provides tailored health resources and risk assessments specific to each user's individual health factors.

## What problem does it solve?

Many people have difficulty accessing health resources tailored to their own individual health needs. Our app will make it easier to find the right resources to help people reach their health goals.

## How does it work?

The app will work by gathering data from the user's health profile. It will then use this data to create tailored health resources and risk assessments specific to the user's individual health factors.

## What are the benefits?

The app will provide users with a more personalized approach to health and wellness. It will allow people to make better informed decisions about their health and provide them with more accurate and tailored health resources.

## What is the market potential?

The global health and wellness market is estimated to be worth over $4.2 trillion by 2022. With the growing demand for personalized health and wellness services, our app has the potential to tap into this rapidly growing market.

## How will it make money?

We plan to make money by offering premium subscriptions and in-app purchases. We also plan to partner with health and wellness brands to offer sponsored content and other services.

## What is the team's experience?

Our team is comprised of experienced entrepreneurs, health professionals and software developers. We have the necessary skills and experience to make our app a success.

## What is the timeline?

We plan to launch our app in Q4 2021. This timeline will allow us enough time to develop and test the app and bring it to market.

## What are the next steps?

The next steps are to secure funding, develop the app and launch it. We are currently in the process of raising seed funding and are looking for potential investors.
